## Unreleased

### Added

- Initial Flutter adapter package split from `unrouter`.
- Preserved Flutter-first API naming and behavior (`Unrouter`, `route`,
  `context.unrouter`, shell navigation, machine commands).
- Added package-local Flutter example and widget test suite.
- Removed `unrouter_machine` dependency; now only depends on `unrouter`.
