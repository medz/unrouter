## Unreleased

### Added

- Initial Flutter adapter package for `unrouter`.
- Inherited core `Unrouter` directly to keep the adapter runtime lean.
- Added a complete Flutter example covering shell navigation, guards,
  redirects, loader routes, and typed push/pop flows.
- Added functional runtime/widget tests for route-information sync, scope
  helpers, delegate fallbacks, and shell branch behavior.
