# Example App

This example demonstrates Unrouter's hybrid routing plus Navigator 1.0
compatibility. The Home screen includes buttons for `showDialog`,
`showModalBottomSheet`, `showMenu`, and `Navigator.push` to show that these
APIs work when `enableNavigator1` is enabled (default).

## Running

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```
